# Word_to_Vec_Model
Created a model that generates an embedding word vector using skip gram approach using wikipedia dataset.

## Created 1-layer neural network model.
The model uses skip gram approach(neighbour words(context words) are predicted given a current word).
The weights between the input and hidden layer will be learnt while training and will be the required embedding vector for the given corpus.
